# Origami Firmware

Firmware for Origami’s ESP32-S3 handheld: a display, camera, audio, motion sensing, and Lua widgets in one device.

**Private review draft — not approved for public distribution.** This repository starts with one independent snapshot. Publication awaits the source, asset, dependency, and firmware review described in [release review](docs/release-review.md).

## Hardware

The supported target is rev-4 ESP32-S3 N16R8: 16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM, a 240 × 280 ST7789 display, and a TCA6424A I/O expander. Firmware for other boards is not interchangeable.

## Build

Install PlatformIO Core 6.2.0 in a dedicated Python environment, then run:

```sh
pio run -e esp32-s3-menu-n16r8-production
```

This produces a **custom production-policy build**, not an official signed OTA release. The pinned Arduino framework, libraries, and compatibility wrappers are part of the build contract. See [building](docs/building.md).

## Firmware

The initial review candidate is the application-only firmware for release `v0.1.213`. It is held as a private draft release, subject to successful staging. Use its SHA-256 manifest to identify the reviewed bytes. No public release is available yet.

`firmware.bin` is an application image, not a full-device installer. Do not write it at address zero. [Installation notes](docs/installation.md) explain the current review boundary. Credentials and OTA access must be provisioned separately; they are never distributed with this repository. The minimal owner-confirmed SD artwork is included under `sd_flash/`.
